This is my first project written on **JavaScript**. Also on this project I learned how to work with **SASS preprocessor**. The site is **adaptive** for mobile phone, tablet and desktop.

In order to **start the calculation** you should press the "Начать расчет" button.
- enter the date in the required type YYYY-MM-DD;
- type in your monthly budget;
- then you can enter your mandatory monthly expenses (e.g. rental of an apartment: 10000; car: 2000). Click "Утвердить".
- you can also enter your non-mandatory monthly expenses. 
- click on "Рассчитать".

On the right, you will see the calculation of your daily budget.

You can also calculate the amount of percent savings if you put money in the bank. First click on the "Есть ли накопления" checkbox and then execute the following commands:
- enter the amount of money in the "Сумма" field, which you can give to the bank.
- enter the percent that your bank offers in the "Процент" field. 

On the right, you will see possible savings for 1 month and 1 year.

There are many other things that could be improved in this small project (such as modal windows, input characters and other improvements), but it would not be fair to say that I could write such code at the beginning of my training. 
So you can see my knowledge growing in the following projects :)
